- ok so I had o3 create a PRD that is now used in the README
    - I put the notes from our sessions to get an initial roadmap
- I told Claude to replicate the Mercury UI
    - here is the [artifact](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b3326eec-be07-4cbc-bcb9-6ea308fb0e78)
    - I added Dashboard.js and Teller.js to save what Claude came up with 
- I can't believe I've run into limits both with o3 and with Claude
    - Grok never lets me down
