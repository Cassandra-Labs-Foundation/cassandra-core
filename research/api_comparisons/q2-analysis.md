Document Workflow: Stronger document management with status tracking
Authentication: Basic Auth vs JWT Bearer tokens
API Structure: Uses external schema references (GitHub-hosted YAML files)
Beneficiary Management: Separate customer and account beneficiary systems
Culture Support: Multi-language document support

Response Structure
All responses follow a consistent envelope pattern:

ApiSuccessEnvelope wrapper
data property containing the response payload
Arrays for list operations
Objects for single entity operations

Notable Capabilities

Instant Card Issuance: Digital cards available immediately for mobile wallets
Mock Transaction Engine: Comprehensive testing without real transactions
Entitlement System: Granular permission management for business accounts
Stop Payment: Support for both ACH and check stop payments
Token Generation: Customer token creation for secure operations
Real-time Account Verification: For external account validation

This is a mature, enterprise-grade banking API with strong business banking features, comprehensive testing capabilities, and robust document/compliance management compared to Unit's more streamlined approach.
