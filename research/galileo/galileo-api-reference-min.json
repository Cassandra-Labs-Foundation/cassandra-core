Galileo's Dispute API 3.0 provides a robust set of endpoints to create dispute claims and manage them through the entire dispute process. Dispute API 3.0 is a RESTful-style API. All verbs are POST. The endpoint names are the /paths in the Open API spec file that forms the basis for this reference. For instructions on using these endpoints, consult these guides: Creating an API 3.0 Dispute — How to follow the flow-intake sequence to create a dispute. Dispute API 3.0 Workflows — Sequence of endpoints to use for each dispute type. Managing API 3.0 Disputes — What to do with disputes after they have been created. Base URL For this API use the tenanted URL that Galileo assigns you: https://{corename}.gft-dispute-api.{env}.gpsrv.com/gft-dispute-api/1.0/endpointpath where corename is the name of your core, as assigned by Galileo. env is the environment: cv for client validation and pd for production. Authentication You must obtain API login credentials from Galileo. If you already have credentials for Program API, you can use those. Unlike the Program API and some other APIs, you pass your credentials in the request header as Authorization: Basic {token}, where {token} is base64-encoded apilogin:transkey. Input format Unlike other Galileo APIs, the Dispute API 3.0 requests accept JSON input only, not x-www-form-urlencoded. Cases 📘NoteMost of the request and response field names are in PascalCase, but a few are in camelCase. This is intended.

For instructions on using this API see the Setup for Installment Loans guide. The Loan API is a separate system from Program API, but shares certain conventions for client development ease of use. For common errors, the Lending system shares status codes with Program API. Other errors, specific to the lending system, have four-digit prefixes unique to that Loan API endpoint.

Versions There is currently one supported version, 1.0, of the Loan API. While developing against the Loan API, please anticipate that the version component of the URI path can change as we develop changes to the Loan API endpoints. In cases where we must introduce breaking changes, they will be introduced behind a new API version. Authentication The Loan API uses the same IP address whitelisting and credential approach as the Program API. You can choose to use their existing credentials or be issued new credentials for use with the Loan API. Follow the authentication steps for the Program API. Connectivity The Loan API does not have a dedicated connectivity endpoint. Basic credential validation and connectivity can be validated by calling one of the system’s read endpoints, such as Get Loan Status with an invalid loanId. The call should connect, authenticate, and return a 1202-01 error indicating an invalid loan id was used. This procedure should not be used as part of an automated process.

Account statuses can be assigned by internal processes or they can be manually changed by the CST or Program API, such as by using Modify Status. When changing an account status using the Modify Status endpoint, make sure the type changes the account status and not the card status only. Account statuses are independent of card statuses. Both the account and card must be in status: N (normal, active) to perform card transactions. In addition, accounts have an account-active flag that is either Y or N. Some internal processes check the active flag to determine whether to perform an action, such as statement generation. See the Card Statuses guide for more information. 🚧ImportantMastercard considers status: C (canceled) and status: Z (canceled without refund) to be permanent statuses. As of 3 Jun 2025, issuers are required to return response_code: 46 for accounts or cards in those two statuses. If you reactivate a card or account that was closed, Mastercard could assess penalties for transactions attempted against that card. If you need to temporarily close an account or card to reopen later, use status: D (disabled). This table indicates whether an account status permits certain types of transactions or account updates. X means that the transaction is permitted, and other characters indicate that performing the transaction is contingent on settings and other factors. Key Columns Active — State of the active flag when the account has this status. Network — Authorizations originating on the card network; an account that is not in status: N can still have its authorizations settled. Pmt — Create Payment endpoint or internal processes; payments using Create Account Transfer can be made only when the receiving account is in status: N. Adj — Create Adjustment endpoint or internal processes, either credit or debit, including Mastercard merchant credits ACH — Incoming ACH transactions, unless otherwise specified Update — Status changes. For updates using Update Account, the account must be in status: N, or you can set UPDCZ to permit updates in statuses C and Z.

When Galileo receives an ISO 8583 authorization request from the network, it performs initial checks such as validating the PIN, verifying account status, and checking account balance. Galileo calculates the response code, converts the request into the Auth API webhook, and passes it to you so that you can make the final decision—whether to accept Galileo's verdict or override. For more information see the Authorization Controller API guide. Versions There are currently two supported versions of the Auth API: 2.0 and 3.0. Version 3 is a breaking change from version 2. See Differences between version 2 and version 3 in the Authorization Controller API guide for details. Security Use HTTPS for the Auth API webhook to ensure fundamental security is in place. Galileo supports TLS 1.2. Galileo uses JSON web tokens (JWTs) to authenticate the webhook. A shared secret encodes and decodes the token. The payload will have the following arguments: iat — Issued-at time exp — Expiration time iss — galileo The times are expressed as Unix epoch time. The token is created using this Python code: Pythonimport jwt from datetime import datetime, timedelta payload = { 'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=5), 'iat': datetime.utcnow(), 'iss': 'galileo' } token = jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm='HS256') where secret is the shared secret. The token is placed in the Authorization header field. Security Example This is the header value for exp = 1534274886 and iat = 1534274881: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnYWxpbGVvIiwiaWF0IjoxNTM0Mjc0ODgxLCJleHAiOjE1MzQyNzQ4ODZ9.1xUk4iNFGWLo01MyJUHXRlyrNlzwPvDMSXpN38TrblU Paths You provide a base URL, hosted by a server in your system. Galileo invokes your webhook at the /Authorization endpoint. Examples These are some examples of how you use the Auth API. See Overrides in the Authorization Controller API guide for details. Overriding the response code Galileo receives an authorization request and plans to approve it (response_code: 00) because all validation checks passed and the account has sufficient funds. Galileo sends the Auth API webhook to you. You determine that the transaction amount is above a limit, so you return response_code: 61 (Exceeds amount limit), and the transaction is declined. When you maintain the balance: For your program, you may be the system of record for client accounts instead of Galileo. Galileo gets a balance inquiry, but because Galileo does not have the latest balance, Galileo invokes your Auth API webhook. You return the balance available in the available_balance field and Galileo relays that balance to the network. Client initiates transfer Galileo receives an authorization request and the cardholder has insufficient funds, so Galileo calculates response_code: 51. Galileo sends you the Auth API webhook. You see that the account has insufficient funds, so you initiate a transfer by populating the transfer_prn and transfer_amount. (This must be set up specially at Galileo before using.) After the transfer, the cardholder has sufficient funds, and Galileo approves the request.

Events API","method":null,"endpoint":null,"description":"Events API (formerly known as Alerts API) is a collection of webhooks that Galileo clients can receive to be informed of system events in real time. For example, when a card authorization is approved, Galileo can send an event to you with information about the authorization, within seconds of the approval. In addition to the information provided here, see the About the Events API guide. Events are grouped into the following categories: Account Events — Account changes that do not affect the available balance* Authorization Events — Transactions that arrive at Galileo over network rails Settlement Events — Settlements that arrive at Galileo in the settlement batch file Transaction Events — Transactions that do not originate on network rails§ Each category is posted to a separate webhook. For example, account events are posted to /AccountEvent and transaction events are posted to /Transaction. Events are identified by the type field in the request body. For example, when a cardholder has successfully completed the enrollment process for a card, the event type will be app_completed. Some events have further distinguishing fields; for example, for mobile tokenization events, there is a wallet_type field that identifes the wallet \"vendor\" (Apple, Google, Samsung, etc.). Galileo also uses a 4-character code (msg_id) for the events in other systems like the CST. For example, CAPP corresponds to the app_completed type. You can find a list of the msg_ids with their respective types on the Event Codes page. Each category has an index that lists each event along with its description, 4-character msg_id, event type field, and a table of the fields that are sent in the event. Account Events Index Authorization Events Index Settlement Events Index Transaction Events Index 📘NoteGalileo sends all events asynchronously so that they don't block or slow down transaction and backoffice processing. Unlike Auth API and External Trans API, the response you send to an event message does not control the outcome of a transaction. * An exception is DSPC: dispute_pc, which notifies that provisional credit has been applied to an account for a dispute. § Card loads that originate over network rails have a corresponding payment transaction, indicated by BPMT: pmt.","parameters":[],"response_fields":[],"status_codes":[]},{"url":"https://docs.galileo-ft.com/pro/reference/api-reference-events-api-about-events-api-paths-and-content-types","type":"concept","category":"General","title":"Paths and Content Types","method":null,"endpoint":null,"description":"You provide a base URL, hosted by a server in your system. Paths are relative to that URL. As mentioned in the overview, events are grouped into categories, and posted to the webhook for that category: Account Events: /AccountEvent Authorization Events: /Authorization Settlement Events: /Settlement Transaction Events: /Transaction Galileo can send the event messages as JSON or form data, and Galileo can receive your responses as JSON or XML. All fields are sent as strings. For example, $500 is sent as \"500.00\". Default and optional fields The fields to include with each event are defined by a template. The fields in the default template are marked as Default in the Fields table on every event page. As you work with Galileo to set up your events, you start with the default template; then, if necessary, you can add optional fields or remove default fields. Empty fields When there is no data to return for a field, the key is still included in the message with an empty value.

Attempt is the attempt number. The first attempt is the first time Galileo tries to send the event, so with RETRY = 5, there will be 6 attempts total. Retry Delay Seconds is how many seconds Galileo will wait to do the next attempt if the previous attempt fails. The retry interval increases exponentially for each retry by multiplying RTRDL by Attempt^2. The first retry attempt has a value of 1, so the first delay will be the value in RTRDL. The second attempt is 2 squared times RTRDL or 4 x 60, which equals 240 seconds.

(Galileo supports TLS 1.2.) In addition to in-transit encryption, you must also perform validation on the messages received on these endpoints to ensure that they are indeed from Galileo. Based on the Content-Type of the request, which is configured according to your request, validation involves either a JWT (JSON web token) or a computed HMAC signature. Both involve use of a shared-secret key but have a number of differences that should be considered. Similarities Both HMAC and JWT require that you configure a shared secret with Galileo. Both use the non-standard Encryption-Type header, which specifies the underlying algorithm used. Both have a value of galileo for the standard UserID header. Differences HMAC is used for Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests, whereas JWT is used for Content-Type: application/json. Validation for requests that use HMAC is done using the non-standard Signature header, whereas those that use JWT use the standard Authorization header. JWT Validation The alternative approach (as shown in the Differences section) is to validate the JWT. For example, the request might look something like this: HTTPPOST /Authorization HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:3150 X-Request-ID: 92c341e2-8b50-45bb-805c-8d0aa76124b8 Encryption-Type: JWT-HS256 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Length: 380 Accept: */* User-Agent: python-requests/2.9.1 Connection: keep-alive Date: 20201110:163953UTC User-ID: galileo Content-Type: application/json Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnYWxpbGVvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjA1MDUxNTkzLCJleHAiOjE2MDUwNTE1OTZ9.jjHsPgAOZc13EGAGeqVHVHH0Nu_ajE5XpDcbDYmS1GI { \"balance\": \"195.70\", \"merch_name\": \"Target 2400 South 200 West\", \"network\": \"M\", \"timestamp\": \"20101108:201512UTC\", \"cur_code\": \"840\", \"tran_type\": 5, \"prn\": \"155174792582\", \"prod_id\": 5042, \"amount\": -8.95, \"blank\": null, \"mcc\": \"4678\", \"merch_num\": \"321654321654\", \"prog_id\": 511, \"type\": \"auth\", \"id\": \"M.auth.2994428\", \"tran_id\": \"2994428\", \"merch_loc\": \"Salt Lake City, UT\" } Again, the implementation is language/library dependent, but it might look something like this if you use Python: Pythonimport jwt # Shared with Galileo secret_key = 'wow_i_should_encrypt_this' # This library wants us to ignore the 'Bearer' part, as we should token = request.headers['Authorization'].split(' ')[1] try: jwt.decode( token, secret_key, issuer=request.headers['User-ID'], algorithms=['HS256'] # Won't change for JWT ) except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError: print('Oh no, the JWT is expired!') raise except jwt.DecodeError: print(\"Oh no, this request probably isn't from Galileo!\") raise HMAC validation For example, a request that looks similar to the following: HTTPPOST /Authorization HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:3150 X-Request-ID: 234dd0dc-8e44-4311-b334-961b1e058b72 Encryption-Type: HMAC-SHA256 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Length: 424 Accept: */* User-Agent: python-requests/2.9.1 Connection: keep-alive Signature: b0+KPPtDyvuWdx55QJ+5YQq0K0UkXPurk9cRMHFXLSc= Date: 20201110:161601UTC User-ID: galileo Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded token_type=Apple+Inc.&settle_amt=20.00&auth_id=18056167&auth_network=M&local_surcharge_amt=2.00&merch_name=Arbys+1532&merchant=Arbys+1532+Rochester+MN&de39=00&billing_amt=30.00&original_auth_id=5&mcc=5814&settle_surcharge_amt=2.50&billing_curr_code=666&merch_num=945000153210000&auth_tran_type=5&settle_curr_code=555&local_curr_code=444&merch_loc=Rochester%2C+MN&card_not_present=N&amount=30.00&local_amt=10.00&sign_amount=- Create a dictionary/hash map using the header field of the request: Pythonsignature_data = { 'Content-Length': request['Content-Length'], 'Encryption-Type': request['Encryption-Type'], 'User-ID': request['User-ID'], 'Content-Type': request['Content-Type'], 'Date': request['date'] } Add the values from the form data in the request body to the hash map based on their key. With a properly parsed body, you might be able to do something like this: Pythonfor field_key, field_value in request_body.items(): signature_data[field_key] = field_value or more explicitly: Pythonsignature_data['token_type'] = 'Apple Inc.' signature_data['settle_amt'] = '20.00' ... for this simple case, assuming that you've parsed the form data into some sort of dictionary/hashmap, Sort the hashmap, by key, alphabetically. For example, your map contains something like this: Pythonsignature_data = { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'Encryption-Type': 'HMAC-SHA256', 'billing_amt': '30.00', 'token_type': 'Apple Inc.' } Notice that billing_amt comes after Content-Type, even though b comes before c in the English alphabet. In short, the set of upper-case letters comes before the set of lower-case letters. Compute the string: Pythonsignature_string = '' for key in signature_data: signature_string += key + '|' + base64encode(signature_data[key]) Compute the HMAC-SHA256 signature over this string, using the shared secret key. The specifics of this are language dependent based on the library used, among other considerations, but in Python it might look something like this: Pythonimport base64 import hashlib import hmac # Shared with Galileo secret_key = 'wow_i_should_encrypt_this' signature = base64.b64encode( hmac.new( secret_key, signature_string, hashlib.sha256 ).digest(), ) if signature != request.headers['Signature']: print('Oh no!') If you are having problems with this verification, ensure that all capitalization, whitespace, and other factors are maintained when computing the signature. Additionally, some HTTP libraries change the D in User-ID to look like User-Id, for instance. The easiest way to validate these things is to obtain a raw version of the request and ensure that nothing has changed from the time it was received over the network socket to the time it made it into your code.","parameters":[],"response_fields":[],"status_codes":[]},{"url":"https://docs.galileo-ft.com/pro/reference/api-reference-events-api-account-closed","type":"concept","category":"General","title":"account_closed","method":null,"endpoint":null,"description":"An account was closed in the Customer Service Tool.

First, collect the following header fields into a hash map (remember to use an upper-case D on User-ID): Pythondata = { \"Content-Length\": \"178\", \"Encryption-Type\": \"HMAC-SHA256\", \"User-ID\": \"galileo\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"Date\": \"20170504:141752UTC\" } Add the form parameters and sort by key, resulting in the following: Pythondata = { \"Content-Length\": \"178\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"Date\": \"20170504:141752UTC\", \"Encryption-Type\": \"HMAC-SHA256\", \"User-ID\": \"galileo\", \"account_id\": \"2011\", \"amount\": \"45\", \"prn\": \"155200002022\", \"prod_id\": \"1701\", \"prog_id\": \"305\", \"return_code\": \"R01\", \"source\": \"Chase Bank\", \"source_id\": \"6426460\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-09 11:20:33 MST\", \"type\": \"ach_credit_fail\" } If you are using a dictionary/hash map in your code, be aware that some languages do not sort the keys automatically nor honor insertion order. For each value, compute the Base64 encoding of each of the values in data (using the UTF-8 encoding of the values): Pythondata = { \"Content-Length\": \"MTc4\", \"Content-Type\": \"YXBwbGljYXRpb24veC13d3ctZm9ybS11cmxlbmNvZGVk\", \"Date\": \"MjAxNzA1MDQ6MTQxNzUyVVRD\", \"Encryption-Type\": \"SE1BQy1TSEEyNTY=\", \"User-ID\": \"Z2FsaWxlbw==\", \"account_id\": \"MjAxMQ==\", \"amount\": \"NDU=\", \"prn\": \"MTU1MjAwMDAyMDIy\", \"prod_id\": \"MTcwMQ==\", \"prog_id\": \"MzA1\", \"return_code\": \"UjAx\", \"source\": \"Q2hhc2UgQmFuaw==\", \"source_id\": \"NjQyNjQ2MA==\", \"timestamp\": \"MjAxOS0xMC0wOSAxMToyMDozMyBNU1Q=\", \"type\": \"YWNoX2NyZWRpdF9mYWls\" } Now, build the following string, concatenating key-value pairs with | and leaving no space between successive key-value pairs: Content-Length|MTc4Content-Type|YXBwbGljYXRpb24veC13d3ctZm9ybS11cmxlbmNvZGVkDate|MjAxNzA1MDQ6MTQxNzUyVVRDEncryption-Type|SE1BQy1TSEEyNTY=User-ID|Z2FsaWxlbw==account_id|MjAxMQ==amount|NDU=prn|MTU1MjAwMDAyMDIyprod_id|MTcwMQ==prog_id|MzA1return_code|UjAxsource|Q2hhc2UgQmFuaw==source_id|NjQyNjQ2MA==timestamp|MjAxOS0xMC0wOSAxMToyMDozMyBNU1Q=type|YWNoX2NyZWRpdF9mYWls Finally, using the shared secret key you have set up with Galileo, and the hashing algorithm in the Encryption-Type header field, compute the signature of the string above, and Base64-encode the result. Assuming the shared secret key is mysecret (encoded in UTF-8) and the encryption type is HMAC-SHA256, you should get: DkY7o3ynLLvNvnDHraFicMP+gK/UOAL09WsNj2mQ1ww= Python 3 Code Snippet The code below demonstrates how to compute the signature using Python 3: Pythonimport base64 import hmac from typing import Dict import urllib.parse HEADERS_TO_SIGN = ( \"Content-Length\", \"Content-Type\", \"Encryption-Type\", \"User-ID\", \"Date\", ) def normalize_header_key(header_key: str) -> str: \"\"\"Normalize header key/name @param header_key: Header key, e.g. \"Content-length\". @return Normalized header key \"\"\" if header_key.lower() == \"user-id\": return \"User-ID\" else: return header_key.title() def compute_signature(headers: Dict[str, str], payload: Dict[str, str], secret: str) -> str: \"\"\"Compute the Galileo HMAC-SHA256 signature of a request, using key. :param headers: HTTP request headers :param payload: HTTP request payload, parsed into a dictionary/hash map.

Transaction codes identify where a transaction originated and what kind of transaction it is. The first two characters of a transaction code are the Activity Type and the remaining characters are the otype. For example: SE5 — Mastercard Banknet retail settlement activity type SE (Mastercard Banknet settlement) otype 5 (retail sale) VIL — Visa preauthorization activity type VI (Visa authorization) otype L (preauthorization) See Classifying transactions in the About Transactions guide for more information. 📘NoteMost payment (PM), adjustment (AD) and fee (FE) otypes are in the Funds Flow document that Galileo provides you. However, some payments and adjustments are triggered by card transactions; those universal otypes are included in the tables below. To see where these codes are visible, go to Activity type and transaction type in the Galileo system in the About Transactions guide. Additionally, a list of Galileo system fees can be found in About Fees. Transaction type (otype) lookup This table provides a quick reference for standalone otypes that are related to card transactions. To see how the otypes combine with the activity types, see Transaction codes. These codes are case-sensitive.

Other numerical otypes (such as for fees) are returned as integers without leading zeros. § In most cases, otype: L is present only with authorization act_types, but in some cases it appears with a settlement act_type. Transaction codes The tables below show how the activity type combines with the otype to create a transaction code (trans_code). Your program may not use all of the codes shown here. Use the curated list that Galileo gave you to see all of the otypes for your program. Authorization and settlement These tables show transaction codes for transactions over card networks. The first table contains the codes associated with transactions that arrive through the authorization stream, and the second contains codes associated with transactions from the settlement batch files. Authorization stream See Authorization for more information. In Program API responses, denied authorizations are DDA for Maestro and DAA for all other networks.

To differentiate, call Get All Transaction History or open the All Transactions screen in the CST and find the authorization that corresponds to the SE5 transaction. If the authorization (AUA) and backout (BO5) have the same timestamp as the SE5, then the SE5 is a force post. See Unmatched settlements in the ledger for more information. Other transaction codes You may also encounter some of these network-related transaction codes: SDV — Maestro reversal debiting balance VSV — Visa reversal debiting balance VSRW — Visa cash reversal VSF, ISF — Visa and Interlink fee collection VSJ, ISJ, PLJ — Visa, Interlink and Plus adjustments AUM, VIM, STM — Unmatched reversal or completion (AU11 for Mastercard unmatched completion) Card loads Card loads that take place on network rails first arrive at Galileo in the auth stream, where they get an authorization table entry, and then they are converted into payments (PM) to post to the cardholder account. Reversals are converted to adjustments (AD). In the RDFs you will see the Card load auth codes in the AUTH TRANSACTION CODE field and the Card load posted and Card load reversal posted codes in the TRANSACTION CODE/TYPE field. All of these transaction codes are case-sensitive. See Card loads for more information.

Overview Galileo is on a mission to continuously improve the products and services available to our clients. Our goal is to minimize client impacts when introducing enhancements, new product features and capability improvements. However, from time to time, a change may require a client action to prevent existing capabilities from breaking. The purpose of this document is to outline what changes Galileo considers a breaking change versus a non-breaking change, as well as, how we will provide client communication in the event of a breaking change. Definitions Non-breaking changes Non-breaking changes are code changes that are not expected to be disruptive to clients, who can adapt to these changes at their own discretion. Clients should be able to handle these changes without any notice from Galileo. Example of non-breaking changes Adding a new, optional, input field to a request that does not change the behavior of existing fields Adding a new required field that has default values Adding a new response code for new functionality that does not impact existing response codes Adding a new field or data element to an existing response payload returned from Galileo services that does not change the meaning of existing fields Adding an optional request header Adding a new endpoint Removal of an optional request header Updating a parameter description Updating sequence numbers in accordance with NACHA rules Breaking changes Breaking changes are code changes that will require clients to adapt to these changes to avoid potential disruption. Galileo will communicate these changes to clients before rolling out these changes. Example of breaking changes Requiring a new input field Making a previously optional input field a required field Updating an existing field or data element in an existing response payload returned from Galileo services Changing the agreed details of a file exchange (e.g., file name patterns, field widths, field data types, ordering of fields, format changes, adding/removing fields in fixed width files, line endings in ACH files) Changes to request/response headers Updating existing required product configuration parameters Communication We will communicate breaking changes to clients before rolling out these changes. However, if a change is necessary for critical legal, security, or compliance concerns, we will deploy a breaking change without prior notice. For all other breaking changes we will communicate with clients before the release. This communication will include documentation. Clients will be able to complete client validations, in advance of a change to the production environment. Notification will be completed utilizing existing channels, for example, product roadmap, monthly updates and client meetings.","parameters":[],"response_fields":[],"status_codes":[]},{"url":"https://docs.galileo-ft.com/pro/reference/claim-attachments-add","type":"api_endpoint","category":"General","title":"/claim/attachments/add","method":"post","endpoint":"https://{corename}.gft-dispute-api.{env}.gpsrv.com/gft-dispute-api/1.0/claim/attachments/add","description":"This resource is used to add attachments to an existing claim","parameters":[{"name":"providerId","type":"int32","required":true,"description":"Galileo-issued unique provider identifier.

Example error responses In most cases, the errors object is at the same level as the response_data object, as shown here: JSONXML{ \"status_code\": 2, \"status\": \"Invalid parameter(s)\", \"system_timestamp\": \"2020-08-13 10:20:46\", \"response_data\": {}, \"processing_time\": 0.28, \"echo\": { \"transaction_id\": \"hymteqhhj9qlyrebeb8ktmk2GEwfql\", \"provider_transaction_id\": \"\", \"provider_timestamp\": null }, \"errors\": [ \"achAccountNo='achAccountNo' is required and cannot be empty\", \"achRoutingNo='achRoutingNo' is required and cannot be empty\" ] } <response> <status_code>2</status_code> <status>Invalid parameter(s)</status> <system_timestamp>2020-08-13 10:20:08</system_timestamp> <response_data/> <processing_time>0.228</processing_time> <echo> <transaction_id>hymteqhhj9qlyrebeb8ktmk2GEwfql</transaction_id> <provider_transaction_id/> <provider_timestamp/> </echo> <errors> <error>achAccountNo='achAccountNo' is required and cannot be empty</error> <error>achRoutingNo='achRoutingNo' is required and cannot be empty</error> </errors> </response> In a few rare cases, the errors object is nested inside the response_data object: JSONXML{ \"status_code\": 2, \"status\": \"Invalid parameter(s)\", \"processing_time\": 0.699052095413208, \"response_data\": { \"errors\": { \"error\": \"State does not match zip\" } }, \"echo\": { \"provider_transaction_id\": \"\", \"provider_timestamp\": null, \"transaction_id\": \"fb5c0d2a-a740-4ebc-aaab-5ec119d449b8\" }, \"system_timestamp\": \"2024-12-17 10:58:40\", \"rtoken\": \"7f583690-45a4-47c6-b53c-2be3a0e1f949\" } <response> <status_code>2</status_code> <status>Invalid parameter(s)</status> <processing_time>0.699052095413208</processing_time> <response_data> <errors> <error>State does not match zip</error> </errors> </response_data> <echo> <provider_transaction_id></provider_transaction_id> <provider_timestamp></provider_timestamp> <transaction_id>fb5c0d2a-a740-4ebc-aaab-5ec119d449b8</transaction_id> </echo> <system_timestamp>2024-12-17 10:58:40</system_timestamp> <rtoken>7f583690-45a4-47c6-b53c-2be3a0e1f949</rtoken> </response> Cloudflare response codes Galileo uses Cloudflare for its API web services. Cloudflare returns standard HTTP response codes as well as codes specific to the application. The material for this table comes from the Cloudflare developer site. CodeDescription200OK — Request was successful.301Moved Permanently — The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.400Bad Request — The web client did not send a correct request to the server. This is a web client error: malformed request syntax, invalid request, message framing, or deceptive request routing403Forbidden — If you’re seeing a 403 error without Cloudflare branding, this is always returned directly from the origin web server, not Cloudflare, and is generally related to permission rules on the server. Cloudflare will serve 403 responses if the request violated either a default web-application firewall (WAF)-managed rule enabled for all orange-clouded Cloudflare domains or a WAF-managed rule enabled for that particular zone.404Not Found — Origin server was unable or unwilling to find the resource requested. This usually means the host server could not find the resource.499Client Close Request — nginx-specific response code to indicate when the connection has been closed by the web client while the server is still processing its request, making the server unable to send a status code back.500Internal Server Error — Error 500 generally indicates an issue with the origin web server.502Bad Gateway — Cloudflare is unable to establish contact with the origin web server.503Service Unavailable — The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.504Gateway Timeout — Cloudflare is unable to establish contact with the origin web server.520Web server returns an unknown error — The origin server returns an empty, unknown, or unexpected response to Cloudflare.521Web server is down — The origin server refused connections from Cloudflare. Security solutions at the origin may be blocking legitimate connections from certain Cloudflare IP addresses.524A timeout occurred — Cloudflare was able to complete a TCP connection to the origin server but did not receive a timely HTTP response. In the event that a TCP session is interrupted by AWS-firewall node rebalancing, Cloudflare will send 502 or 521.530This error is returned along with a 1xxx error.","parameters":[],"response_fields":[],"status_codes":[{"code":"200","description":"OK — Request was successful."},{"code":"301","description":"Moved Permanently — The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs."},{"code":"400","description":"Bad Request — The web client did not send a correct request to the server.

(In this context, \"transaction\" does not refer to a financial transaction but to the request/response pair of an API call.) For all endpoints but one, the transactionId is a max 60-character string, preferably a UUID. For the Create Adjustment endpoint the transactionId must be a 64-bit integer that is less than 9223372036854775807. When endpoints use transactionId for idempotency, Galileo validates that a transactionId is unique per successful API call. If the request is identical to a previous combination of transactionId + providerId + endpoint, within the last 90 days, the endpoint returns status_code: 24 (Duplicate transaction). If you want to see the status code for the original successful request, use Get Call Status with the original transactionId for requestTransactionId, and the endpoint name in camelCase for requestMethodName Keep in mind that with the reversal endpoints such as Reverse Adjustment, you pass the transactionId from the original call as the transactionId for the reverse call, such that a Create Adjustment call and the corresponding Reverse Adjustment call have the same transactionId. But because the system looks at a combination of transactionId + providerId + endpoint, the reverse transaction is not considered a duplicate. If an API call is unsuccessful, the transactionId can be used again in future attempts. Once successful, the transactionId cannot be used again for 90 days.

Create Destination Account — Uses a combination of the UUID and the XID to ensure a duplicate destination account is not created. Endpoints without idempotency checks There is no idempotency check for read-only endpoints such as Get Balance, Verify Account, or Search Biller Directory.

If you are not PCI compliant, you can use the CAD to identify individual cards. Galileo recommends that you pass the CAD for accountNo instead of the PAN, where permitted by the endpoint. The full PAN is available as follows when you are PCI compliant: RDFs — CARD NUMBER Program API — card_number Create Account Create Virtual Card Account (never returns masked value) Add Account Get Card Get Account Cards Replace Lost/Stolen Card Expiry date The expiry date of a card is PCI-sensitive data only when it accompanies the full PAN. RDFs — EXPIRATION DATE Auth API — expiration_date Events API — exp_date Program API — expiry_date Create Account Create Virtual Card Account Add Account Get Card Get Account Cards Replace Lost/Stolen Card CVV The CVV is returned in the card_security_code field of Program API endpoints only if you are PCI compliant. Create Account Create Virtual Card Account Add Account Replace Lost/Stolen Card PIN Galileo never includes the PIN, masked or unmasked, in Program API responses, Events API messages, the Auth API, or the RDFs. If you employ a Galileo PIN-set method in your interface, the PIN may pass through your system depending on the method: Direct render — PIN does not pass through your system Direct POST — PIN does pass through your system; PCI compliance required If you want to provide the PIN to your cardholders, use the PIN Retrieval Service, which passes the PIN directly to the cardholder. SSN When passing the SSN in an enrollment endpoint, always use the id input parameter. This value is masked in data outputs by default unless you are PCI compliant. The contents of the id2 input parameter, on the other hand, are never masked. See Using the id and idType parameters for more information. The SSN of an account holder is returned by these Program API endpoints: ssn Get Card Switch Product Reissue Card id when idType: 2 Verify Enrollment Get Enrollment Info In the Customer Master RDF, the SSN field contains the SSN but not other values that you input for id. If you are not PCI compliant, you receive only blank spaces. The contents of the ID2 field are not masked. Parameters These provider parameters control the exposure of sensitive data.

You can use this endpoint for personalized, instant issue, and secondary products. This endpoint runs CIP if you are using Galileo's integrated CIP process. In contrast with the Start Enrollment endpoint, Create Account creates a customer record and at the same time creates an account. Depending on product settings, it also creates a card and loads funds onto it. Consult the Creating an Account procedure for instructions on using this endpoint, and consult the Customer ID Verification guide for how to use this endpoint with Galileo's integrated CIP solution. The instructions include a flowchart to illustrate how Create Account works in the Galileo system. Also see Create Account vs Add Account in the About Accounts guide. 📘NoteYou can receive PCI-sensitive data only if your provider parameters permit it. Duplicate use of customer ID Galileo can configure your product parameters to allow or disallow the duplicate use of customer IDs such as SSNs across your programs. (If one of your prospective customers already has a product with another Galileo partner, no duplicate is detected.) CIP response If you are using Galileo's integrated CIP solution, the Create Account response includes the verdict. Consult Create Account and Create Virtual Account Process in the Customer ID Verification (CIP/KYC) guide for more information. Test names in the CV environment In the CV environment only, you can use specific names with the Create Account endpoint to trigger different CIP responses. For the firstName, middleName, and lastName parameters, use these values: John F Smith — Triggers a CIP failure (F) John R Smith — Triggers a CIP refer (R) John P Smith — Triggers a CIP pass (P) Do not use these test names in Production. Required fields Most input parameters for this endpoint are not required, to accommodate various use cases. If you would like some of the parameters to be required, populate the PINED product parameter with the parameters to be required. For example: idType,id. If this endpoint returns a status code that does not match a status code that is specific to this endpoint, it may be an enrollment status code.

Updating the ship-to address When updating the ship-to address for a customer, the elements shipToAddress1, shipToCity, shipToState, and shipToPostalCode are required – shipToAddress2 is optional. You can retrieve the current customer ship-to address data using the Get Account Cards endpoint. By default, the embosser sends the card to the primary address. To ship to a different address than the primary, use the ship-to address fields. If you pass shipToAddressPermanent: 1 the embosser will always send cards to the ship-to address; otherwise, the ship-to address is used only for the current order.","parameters":[{"name":"apiLogin","type":"string","required":true,"description":"Web service username, as provided by Galileo.
