## üë• Sample User Stories

**As a Staff Accountant**, I want to generate a draft 5300 Call Report with one click, so I can quickly review and validate required regulatory data each quarter.

**As a Credit Union COO**, I want to click on a journal entry and see the underlying loan/member details and support documents, so I can answer auditor or examiner questions without asking the accounting team.
