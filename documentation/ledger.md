- We need to connect Hans to Lindsay to talk about how audits work

- Our goal is to apply's Elon's algo so that we simplify the ledger so that an audit goes from 2 months to 2 weeks

- Questions from Hans
    - General understanding of the business (more for my sake)
        - Look at the diagram on the [Pynthia Memo](https://ringed-catsup-282.notion.site/Pynthia-The-Future-of-Credit-Unions-16323b3ffde080c5bd51cabfbcff244e?pvs=74)
        - we run our new core in parallel to the credit union's pre-existing core so that the migration is incremental
            - all of teh fintech users are managed through the new core, and once the bank feels comfortable they can start slowly migrating their pre-existing customers to the new core
    - Overview of financial products currently offered

                - Life Insurance
    - Any major upcoming events (e.g., capital raising, debt refinancing, etc)
        - this is about fundraising and financing for the bank itself so that they can report
        - for internal management, banks may not care about GAAP as much as adjusted metrics
        - to what extent do these accounting requirements change from the NCUA?
    - Legal entity structure
        - how does NCUA audit fintech partnerships? Do the audit at the subsidiary level? 
        - Hans needs to look at Synapse bankrupcy documentation
        - discuss multi-bank
    - Past year financial statements (audited if available)
        - try to see if we can get these from Katia
    - Most recent trial balance and existing chart of account
    - Understanding the reporting requirements (board, loan compliance, tax, shareholder)?
        - try get these reporting requirements from Lindsay
    - Are there specific KPIs the credit union wants to track? (will influence the granularity of the revenue / cost tracking)
