# what are the relevant regulation/compliance/audit requirements/standards?

we have identified the following requirements and standards:

- requirements
- standards
    - payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS)
    - statement on standards for attestation engagements (SSAE)
        - system and organization controls (SOC)
    - [open banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk)
    - [FFIEC IT examination handbook](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov)
    - [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) (infosec)

we do not mention AML/KYC above, because we consider those requirements to apply broadly beyond the banking core.
