# Compliance 

This is meant to be a living document outlining our compliance protocol in a way that can serve as a check-list for a our fintech partners 

## Best Practices for Fintech Partners

_"Sponsor banks have to show their regulators that they are doing business with valid, ongoing concerns...In a worst-case scenario for a bank, the fintech may exhaust its funds, leading to either a sudden closure of accounts with potential customer harm and [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] CFPB issues or a transfer of the program to the bank for unwinding, resulting in a substantial financial loss for the bank."_ [c]

_"the fintech should arrive prepared with a comprehensive vision for its product structure and a nearly finalized draft outlining the desired flow of funds."_ [c]

- _"⁠Be responsive. Don’t let any potential issues linger. Be quick to investigate and start resolving them. Often, flagging and proactively resolving issues in a fintech program can build credibility with a fintech’s bank partner if handled well."_ [b]

_"De Novo startups need to show funding traction and some business traction,” he continues. “That could be signed go-to-market partners, waitlists, or sample marketing tests that provide reasonable guidance to acquisition costs."_ [a]

_"Have new hires sign up and try to break your compliance controls. I spent hours trying to fool Privacy.com’s fraud controls when I was interviewing"_ [c]

## Principles for an Effective BaaS Partnership

1. Establish clear SLAs connected to routine workflows like reviewing and approving marketing materials. [a]
2. Pin down issue escalation and clarification timelines. [a]

## Regulatory Points in 3rd Party Relationships

Even though Pynthia is regulated by the NCUA, the OCC, FDIC, and FRB have published a list of guidelines [d] for Community Banks that help us develop a robust third-party relationship. Thus, we need to be able to answer the following questions

1. What legal and compliance requirements will apply to the prospective third-party activities?
2. What risk-management and governance practices (including internal controls) will be necessary to manage and mitigate the potential risks?
3. What interaction will the third party have with customers, and how would customer complaints be handled?
4. What third-party policies, processes, and internal controls support performance of the service in alignment with the bank’s expectations and standards? 
5. Has the third party demonstrated an ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) as well as fair lending and consumer protection laws and regulations (as applicable)?
6. Is the third party involved in ongoing litigation or other public matters of concern?7. To what extent does the contract enable the bank to obtain timely information it needs to perform adequate ongoing monitoring, demonstrate compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and respond to regulatory requests?
8. What continuity plans, processes, and controls will the third party maintain to ensure contract adherence, including recovery time and recovery point objectives?Do audit and test results indicate the third party is managing risks and meeting contractual obligations and regulatory requirements effectively? 
9. How will the termination affect the bank’s operations and its compliance with applicable laws and regulations? 
10. How will the bank manage risks associated with the termination or migration, including the impact on customers? 
11. How do documentation and reporting enable the bank’s board of directors to consistently oversee third-party risk management?
12. Has the bank accurately assessed the resources required (including level and expertise of staffing) to manage third-party risks?

_"Most Fintech companies will use more than one bank as their partner. If they want to offer debit cards, credit cards, high-yield savings, and stock trading, they might need 5 different banks or brokerages. Now, you have a situation where no single bank or brokerage has the full customer picture. The only people who would be the intermediary (e.g., the BaaS provider) or the Fintech wallet."_ [e]
    - _"What we saw with Synapse is that it appears to Evolve, and the Fintech companies relied on Synapse as their general ledger. The BaaS provider was helping each Fintech company see accounts at multiple banks. Meaning the BaaS provider (or Fintech company) was the only one who had a 360 view of the customer."_
