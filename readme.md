# Overview

This directory is where we are iterating on our documentation. It serves as a design document just as much as a central place to answer user questions. 

# Structure

We have diagrammed the API documentation for [Column](./column.md), [Increase](./increase.md), and [Lead](./lead-bank.md)

[core-providers-analysis](./core-providers-analysis.md) is the original notes from Lorenzo analyzing both core providers as well as Baas layers
