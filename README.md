# Banking Core Mock Server Blueprint

This blueprint outlines our approach to building a robust, open‐source banking core mock server that leverages TigerBeetle as a high-performance ledger. Our design incorporates insights from three leading BaaS platforms—Column, Increase, and Lead-bank—to ensure clarity, compliance, and operational flexibility.

## Roadmap / To-Do List

We use this README as a living document to track progress and invite contributions.

- **Authentication Module**
  - [x] Decide between OAuth 2.0 vs. Bearer key-based authentication.
  - [x] Implement authentication middleware.
  - [ ] Create endpoints for token issuance, validation, and refresh.

- **Entity Onboarding & KYC**
  - [ ] Design dedicated endpoints for:
    - [ ] Person (`POST /entities/person`, `PATCH /entities/person`)
    - [ ] Business (`POST /entities/business`, `PATCH /entities/business`)
  - [ ] Integrate detailed KYC fields (SSN, DOB, address) and support document uploads.
  - [ ] Implement validation and verification workflows.

- **Account Management**
  - [ ] Build CRUD endpoints for bank accounts:
    - [ ] `POST /bank-accounts`
    - [ ] `GET /bank-accounts`
    - [ ] `GET /bank-accounts/{id}`
    - [ ] `PUT/PATCH /bank-accounts/{id}`
    - [ ] `DELETE /bank-accounts/{id}`
  - [ ] Consider design for handling multiple account numbers/routing if required.
  - [ ] Integrate with TigerBeetle’s account operations.
  - [ ] Document the API.

- **Loan Processing**
  - [ ] Create endpoints for loan lifecycle operations:
    - [ ] `POST /loans`
    - [ ] `GET /loans/{id}`
    - [ ] `PATCH /loans/{id}`
  - [ ] Include parameters for interest rate, term, collateral, etc.
  - [ ] Ensure robust error handling and logging.

- **Transfers Module**
  - [ ] Develop endpoints for ACH transfers:
    - [ ] Initiate ACH transfer
    - [ ] Cancellation endpoint
    - [ ] Reversal endpoint
  - [ ] Develop endpoints for wire transfers:
    - [ ] Initiate wire transfer
    - [ ] Reversal endpoint
  - [ ] Develop endpoints for realtime transfers:
    - [ ] Initiate realtime transfer
    - [ ] Return endpoint
  - [ ] Implement multi-step approval for high-value transactions.
  - [ ] Address edge cases such as partial failures and timeouts.

- **Documents & Reporting**
  - [ ] Provide secure document upload and retrieval:
    - [ ] `POST /documents/upload`
    - [ ] `GET /documents/{id}`
  - [ ] Create endpoints for generating and scheduling reports.

- **Webhooks & Event Logging**
  - [ ] Enable webhook subscription endpoints:
    - [ ] `POST /webhook_endpoints` (and related update/delete endpoints)
  - [ ] Create an audit log endpoint:
    - [ ] `GET /events`
  - [ ] Document payload formats and events.

- **Sandbox & Simulation**
  - [ ] Develop a sandbox mode with test credentials and simulated endpoints.
  - [ ] Provide simulation of edge cases:
    - [ ] Large transactions
    - [ ] Timeouts
    - [ ] Partial failures
  - [ ] Implement debugging support.

- **Counterparty Management**
  - [ ] Build endpoints for managing counterparties:
    - [ ] `POST /counterparties`
    - [ ] `GET /counterparties`
    - [ ] `DELETE /counterparties/{id}`
  - [ ] Optionally implement IBAN validation:
    - [ ] `POST /validate-iban`

- **Compliance & Risk Modules**
  - [ ] Integrate robust compliance data with enhanced KYC fields.
  - [ ] Consider additional fraud detection integrations.
  - [ ] Ensure audit trails for KYC data changes.

- **Administrative & Internal Tools**
  - [ ] Develop admin endpoints for:
    - [ ] Dispute resolution
    - [ ] Manual reviews
    - [ ] Reconciliation
  - [ ] Implement role-based access for internal tools.
